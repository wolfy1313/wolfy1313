**`Full-stack Software Engineer`**

I am a junior software developer that is changing careers! I have successfully completed a 500+ hour Software Engineering immersive and have been freelancing and upskilling every day. I love to create, from music to visual art and now coding projects! Here you can find my official "[PORTFOLIO][https://jeremyharrell.net/]" with some of my recent projects.
